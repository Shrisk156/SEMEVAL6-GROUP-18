# Task-6: CLARITY 2026

This repository contains our work on **SemEval Task-6**, part of the CLARITY 2026 challenge. The goal of this task is to automatically detect and classify ambiguity in political question/answer pairs from presidential interviews.  
It uses a two-level taxonomy: high-level clarity vs. ambiguity and nine fine-grained evasion techniques.  
This helps analyze how politicians strategically use evasive language.  
The task supports NLP research in discourse analysis, fact-checking, and dialogue systems.  
It provides a standardized dataset and evaluation framework for political communication analysis at scale.
