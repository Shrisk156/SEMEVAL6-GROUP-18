And accused the United States of containing China while pushing for diplomatic talks.How would you respond to that? And do you think President Xi is being sincere about getting the relationship back on track as he bans Apple in China?', 'interview_answer': \"Well, look, first of all, theI am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.And so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chineseno one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.And so, really, what this trip was aboutit was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.And I think that one of the things we've doneI've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 monthsis, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.That's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.And it'sfor example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doingwhy was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, To maintain stability. It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the roadeverything from airspace and space in the ocean isthe international rules of the road are abided by.And soand I hope thatI think that Prime Minister XiI mean, Xi has somesome difficulties right now.

And accused the United States of containing China while pushing for diplomatic talks.How would you respond to that?

And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.And so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chineseno one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.And so, really, what this trip was aboutit was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.And I think that one of the things we've doneI've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 monthsis, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.That's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.And it'sfor example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doingwhy was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, To maintain stability. It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the roadeverything from airspace and space in the ocean isthe international rules of the road are abided by.And soand I hope thatI think that Prime Minister XiI mean, Xi has somesome difficulties right now.
